# 100 CSS Utility Classes

Here are 100 classes that I've found useful when developing. You may find them useful depending on your paradigm and workflow. My intent was to be overally specific with the naming so they make sense to anyone reading the HTML document. These classes were inspired by <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#helper-classes">Bootstrap helper classes</a> and <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/utility-classes.html">Foundation utility classes</a> and can be used to extend either library.
